#YelpCampBeta

YelpCamp is a comprehensive website project built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap, which enables users to create and evaluate campgrounds. An account is required to write or assess a campground. This is the capstone project of Colt Steele's web development boot camp course available on Udemy.

The website enables non-registered visitors to view campground and review details. However, logged-in users can modify campground information or comments. Furthermore, users can only delete or edit the content they have created.

The information added by users, including user data, campground information, and comments, will persist and is stored in the Amazon cloud. The project employs a variety of technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery, DOM manipulation, Node.js, Express.js, REST, MongoDB, PassportJS, and Heroku. Data associations connect user data to the respective campgrounds and comments using the reference method, and MongoDB is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance.
